# Imitation_Learning

Class project for the course Reinforcement Learning of the MVA 2017-2018

The goal is to train an agent to play Enduro (https://gym.openai.com/envs/Enduro-v0/) using a reinforcement learning scheme reduced to no-regret learning. The implemented article is :

to No-Regret Online Learning</a>

To implement the algorithm we use python and the open AI gym environment.
