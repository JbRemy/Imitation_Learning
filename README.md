# Imitation_Learning

Work in progress, deadline 19 january 2018.

Class project for the course Reinforcement Learning of the MVA 2017-2018

The goal is to train an agent to play MarioKart 64 using a reinforcement learning scheme reduced to no-regret learning. The two implemented articles are :

* <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/ross10a/ross10a.pdf">Efficient Reductions for Imitation Learning</a>
* <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v15/ross11a/ross11a.pdf">A Reduction of Imitation Learning and Structured Prediction
to No-Regret Online Learning</a>

To implement the algorithm we use python and the <a href="https://github.com/bzier/gym-mupen64plus">OpenAI Gym</a> environment wrapper for the Mupen64Plus N64 emulator.
